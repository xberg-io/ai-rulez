When writing documentation:

## Principles

- Read source code first — verify API accuracy before writing
- Documentation must be correct, concise, and actionable
- Only write docs when explicitly requested — never proactively add docstrings or comments
- Target audience: developers integrating the library, not internal contributors

## API Documentation

- Format: one-line summary, parameters with types, return value, errors, examples
- Examples in ALL supported languages for cross-language libraries
- Inline format per language: rustdoc (Rust), docstrings+type hints (Python), JSDoc (TypeScript), YARD (Ruby), Javadoc (Java), XML docs (C#), PHPDoc (PHP), ExDoc (Elixir), roxygen2 (R), GoDoc (Go)
- Show error handling in examples — don't only show happy paths
- Include runnable code that compiles/passes — never pseudo-code

## READMEs and Guides

- Structure: what it does (1 sentence), install, quick start, API overview, configuration, contributing
- Quick start must be copy-pasteable and work end-to-end
- Badge row: CI status, version, license, coverage
- Link to per-language package registries (PyPI, npm, crates.io, etc.)

## Changelog and Release Notes

- Follow Keep a Changelog format
- Add new entries under the `## [Unreleased]` heading — never under an already-released `## [x.y.z]` section, which is frozen history. Create `## [Unreleased]` if it is missing.
- Group by: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security — create the subsection if it is missing
- Link to relevant PRs and issues
- Highlight breaking changes prominently
