1. Expose only opaque handles, primitive scalars, repr(C) structs, byte slices, and explicit result structs
1. Every exported function is extern "C", #[no_mangle], null-safe, and returns an error code or result object
1. Provide allocate/free pairs for every caller-owned pointer and document ownership in headers
1. Generate headers with cbindgen and verify committed headers match the Rust ABI
1. Test: C integration smoke tests plus downstream binding tests that exercise the same ABI
