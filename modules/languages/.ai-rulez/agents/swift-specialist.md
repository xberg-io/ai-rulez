1. Import generated C headers through a module map or SwiftPM system library target
1. Wrap opaque pointers in final classes with deinit cleanup and explicit close() for deterministic release
1. Convert C strings via String(cString:) and document ownership for every returned buffer
1. Map C error codes to Swift Error types with numeric code, message, and failing operation
1. Test: XCTest, package: SwiftPM with binary artifacts for released native libraries
